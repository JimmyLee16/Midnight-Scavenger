## 🧰 Midnight-Scavenger Address Checker

- A small tool that helps check a list of wallet addresses through the **Midnight API**.  
Supports two input methods — manual entry or importing from a `.csv` file.  
- Created by **VCC Pool** for community purposes.

---

## 📦 Preparation

1. Download **2 files**: `Checksolution_gui(vie).ps1` and `checker.bat` (you can rename them, but make sure to update the `.ps1` filename inside the `.bat` file accordingly, e.g. `check_addresses.ps1` and `run_check.bat`).  
2. Place both files in the **same directory**.

---

## ⚙️ How to Use

Run the `.bat` file to start the tool.

### Method 1 — Using a CSV file
1. Create a file named `address_list.csv` in the same folder as the two script files.  
2. The CSV file **must** have a header `Address` in column A, and subsequent rows should contain the wallet addresses you want to check.

**Example `address_list.csv`:**
Address
addr1q...
addr1z...
addr1xy...

yaml
Copy code

### Method 2 — Manual input
- Run `run_check.bat` (or execute `check_addresses.ps1` directly in PowerShell) — the script will prompt you to enter wallet addresses one by one in the CMD/PowerShell window.

---

## 🔄 How It Works

- The tool calls the **Midnight API** to check each address.  
- Currently, the tool **continuously calls the API** while scanning the list — for long lists, this may cause errors due to API rate limits or timeouts.  
- There is **no detailed log system yet** for failed addresses (to be added in future updates).

---

## ⚠️ Safety & Usage Notes

- **Manually review** `check_addresses.ps1` and `run_check.bat` before running — they execute directly in CMD/PowerShell.  
- If you have a **large list**, split it into smaller CSV files (e.g., 50–100 addresses per file) to avoid rate-limit issues.  
- Do **not** use this tool for illegal purposes or actions that may overload the API.

---

## 🧩 Roadmap (Planned)

- v1.0 — Read from CSV / Manual input — **Completed**  
- v1.1 — Add logging for failed address checks — **Planned**  
- v1.2 — Add API throttling/limiting (delay, retry) — **Planned**

---

## 🛠 Example Commands

**PowerShell (run the script directly):**
```powershell
# Open PowerShell → navigate to the folder → run:
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass 
./check_addresses.ps1
CMD (using .bat file):

cmd
Copy code
cd C:\path\to\folder
run_check.bat
